# driver-drowsiness-detection-using-opencv-and-keras
We'll create a Python drowsiness detection system using OpenCV and Keras to prevent accidents caused by sleepy drivers on highways.
In this Python project, we aim to create a drowsiness detection system to address the issue of drowsy driving, which poses a significant danger on highways. Drivers such as taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, and individuals undertaking long-distance journeys often struggle with sleep deprivation, making it unsafe for them to operate vehicles while feeling drowsy.

Drowsy driving is a leading cause of accidents, emphasizing the need for preventive measures. Therefore, we will utilize the power of Python, along with the libraries OpenCV and Keras, to develop a system that can detect signs of drowsiness and alert the driver accordingly.

By employing computer vision techniques provided by OpenCV, we will analyze real-time video input from a camera placed in the vehicle. The system will identify key facial features, such as eyes and mouth, and track their movements. Drowsiness can be indicated by certain patterns, such as prolonged eye closure or yawning. By monitoring these cues, we can effectively detect when a driver is becoming drowsy.

To achieve this, we will train a deep learning model using Keras. This model will be trained on a dataset containing images of both awake and drowsy drivers, enabling it to learn the distinguishing features of drowsiness. We will leverage techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract relevant features from the facial regions of interest.

During the operation of the system, the trained model will continuously analyze the video stream captured by the camera. If it detects signs of drowsiness, such as excessive eye closure or yawning, it will trigger an alert mechanism. This could involve sounding an alarm, displaying a warning message, or even vibrating the driver's seat to grab their attention.

By building this drowsiness detection system, we aim to mitigate the risk of accidents caused by drowsy driving. By leveraging Python, OpenCV, and Keras, we can effectively monitor driver behavior and provide timely alerts, ensuring that drivers remain attentive and awake while on the road.
